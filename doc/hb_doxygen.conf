# If the CLASS_DIAGRAMS tag is set to YES (the default) Doxygen will
# generate a inheritance diagram (in HTML, RTF and LaTeX) for classes with base
# or super classes. Setting the tag to NO turns the diagrams off. Note that
# this option is superseded by the HAVE_DOT option below. This is only a
# fallback. It is recommended to install and use dot, since it yields more
# powerful graphs.

CLASS_DIAGRAMS         = YES

# You can define message sequence charts within doxygen comments using the \msc
# command. Doxygen will then run the mscgen tool (see
# http://www.mcternan.me.uk/mscgen/) to produce the chart and insert it in the
# documentation. The MSCGEN_PATH tag allows you to specify the directory where
# the mscgen tool resides. If left empty the tool is assumed to be found in the
# default search path.

# If set to YES, the inheritance and collaboration graphs will hide
# inheritance and usage relations if the target is undocumented
# or is not a class.

# If you set the HAVE_DOT tag to YES then doxygen will assume the dot tool is
# available from the path. This tool is part of Graphviz, a graph visualization
# toolkit from AT&T and Lucent Bell Labs. The other options in this section
# have no effect if this option is set to NO (the default)

HAVE_DOT               = YES

# By default doxygen will write a font called FreeSans.ttf to the output
# directory and reference it in all dot files that doxygen generates. This
# font does not include all possible unicode characters however, so when you need
# these (or just want a differently looking font) you can specify the font name
# using DOT_FONTNAME. You need need to make sure dot is able to find the font,
# which can be done by putting it in a standard location or by setting the
# DOTFONTPATH environment variable or by setting DOT_FONTPATH to the directory
# containing the font.

DOT_FONTNAME           = FreeSans

# The DOT_FONTSIZE tag can be used to set the size of the font of dot graphs.

# By default doxygen will tell dot to use the output directory to look for the

# other documented files.

INCLUDE_GRAPH          = YES

# If the ENABLE_PREPROCESSING, SEARCH_INCLUDES, INCLUDED_BY_GRAPH, and

# indirectly include this file.

INCLUDED_BY_GRAPH      = YES

# If the CALL_GRAPH and HAVE_DOT options are set to YES then
# doxygen will generate a call dependency graph for every global function
# or class method. Note that enabling this option will significantly increase
# the time of a run. So in most cases it will be better to enable call graphs
# for selected functions only using the \callgraph command.

CALL_GRAPH             = YES

# If the CALLER_GRAPH and HAVE_DOT tags are set to YES then

# If the DIRECTORY_GRAPH, SHOW_DIRECTORIES and HAVE_DOT tags are set to YES

# The DOT_GRAPH_MAX_NODES tag can be used to set the maximum number of
# nodes that will be shown in the graph. If the number of nodes in a graph
# becomes larger than this value, doxygen will truncate the graph, which is
# visualized by representing a node as a red box. Note that doxygen if the
# number of direct children of the root node in a graph is already larger than
# DOT_GRAPH_MAX_NODES then the graph will not be shown at all. Also note
# that the size of a graph can be further restricted by MAX_DOT_GRAPH_DEPTH.

DOT_GRAPH_MAX_NODES    = 50

# The MAX_DOT_GRAPH_DEPTH tag can be used to set the maximum depth of the
# graphs generated by dot. A depth value of 3 means that only nodes reachable
# from the root by following a path via at most 3 edges will be shown. Nodes
# that lay further from the root node will be omitted. Note that setting this
# option to 1 or 2 may greatly reduce the computation time needed for large
# code bases. Also note that the size of a graph can be further restricted by
# DOT_GRAPH_MAX_NODES. Using a depth of 0 means no depth restriction.

# Set the DOT_TRANSPARENT tag to YES to generate images with a transparent
# background. This is disabled by default, because dot on Windows does not
# seem to support this out of the box. Warning: Depending on the platform used,

# a graph (i.e. they become hard to read).

DOT_TRANSPARENT        = YES

# Set the DOT_MULTI_TARGETS tag to YES allow dot to generate multiple output
# files in one run (i.e. multiple -o and -T options on the command line). This
